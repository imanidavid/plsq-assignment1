# Step 1: Problem Statement

# Business Scenario: Rwanda Premium Coffee Co Analytics

# Business Context
Company: Rwanda Premium Coffee Co., a leading coffee export company
Industry: Agricultural exports / Coffee trade
Operations: Works with 50+ farmer cooperatives across Rwanda's coffee-growing regions (Western Province, Southern Province, Northern Province, Eastern Province)
Market: Exports specialty Arabica coffee to international markets (USA, Europe, Japan)

# Data Challenge
Rwanda Premium Coffee Co. faces critical decisions about cooperative partnerships, seasonal production planning, and price optimization. Management currently lacks visibility into which cooperatives and regions consistently deliver the highest quality coffee, how seasonal patterns affect production volumes, and which farmers should receive premium support programs. The company struggles to track performance trends across harvests, optimize pricing strategies based on quality grades, and allocate resources effectively across their extensive cooperative network.

# Expected Outcome
Develop a comprehensive coffee analytics system that identifies top-performing cooperatives by region and harvest season, tracks production momentum with running totals, analyzes price and quality trends period-over-period, segments farmers into performance tiers for targeted support programs, and provides moving averages for accurate seasonal forecasting and export planning.
